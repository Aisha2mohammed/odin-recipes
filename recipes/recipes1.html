      <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
      <li>500 grams chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons red chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instrucion</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they are softened.</li>
      <li>
        Add the ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala powder, turmeric powder, red
        chili powder, and salt. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour enough water into the pot, about 4 cups, so that the rice is
        submerged. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover the
        pot with a tight-fitting lid and let it cook for about 20 minutes or
        until the rice is cooked and the flavors are well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash the rice and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat some ghee or oil. Add the sliced onions and saut√©
        until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for
        garnishing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once done, fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with the reserved
        fried onions. Serve hot.
